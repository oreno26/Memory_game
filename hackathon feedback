First of all great job on the hackathon!
You showed your experience with DOM manipulation, Functions, Advanced Array Methods and styling!
Its great that you are mixing the cards after each round. Maybe instead of the you win alert you can do a nicer popup for the screen. 
Your game is functional, and your DRY code is excellent.
Really good job and I can see you understand the learned material.
